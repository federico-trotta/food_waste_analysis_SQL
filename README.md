# WORLD FOOD WASTE ANALYSIS (WITH SQL)

In this project, I've hypotized to create a startup that aims to reduce food waste in some particular area of the world.
So I've identified the areas in the world that have the greatest food waste and to understand how to reduce waste.

All the code in this repo is SQL, so this project has been useful to me to learn how SQL is powerful in the data-preparation phase of a data project.

## The main ideas behind this project
If you are not "a technician" or if you just want to understand the main concepts without reading the code, you can take a look at the PDF I created:
